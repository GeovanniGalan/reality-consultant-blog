## No Blame, Just Mapping.

This is the office of a Reality Consultant. We are not a self-help brand selling happiness or a political channel selling outrage. We are diagnosticians providing clarity.

Our mission is to provide a brutally honest and intellectually rigorous "Hitchhiker's Guide" to the hidden systems that shape our lives. We believe that most frustration and confusion stems from a mismatch between the map you are using and the territory you are in. We're here to help you draw a more accurate map.
