## How it forms
- Institutional lying (e.g., "the economy is strong")
- Broken social contracts (e.g., "work hard and you'll get ahead")
- Failed reforms (e.g., "this time it'll be different")

## Output
* Disproportionate emotional reactions (e.g., traffic rage).
* Chronic procrastination on specific tasks.
* A persistent feeling that "something is off" without a clear cause.
