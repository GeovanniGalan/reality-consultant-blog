Have you ever found yourself screaming in your car at a stranger over something tiny? A slow merge, a late signal, a car that cuts you off. Where does that intense, disproportionate anger come from? It feels primal, immediate, and justified in the moment. But what if it's not about the traffic at all?

The anger is real, but the target is a proxy. That car didn't just cut you off in traffic; it cut in line in front of you in life. The rage you're feeling likely isn't about that one driver, it's displaced frustration from a thousand other sources you can't control.

### The Bankruptcy of Belief

In our daily lives, we accumulate something called **Narrative Debt**. It's the compounding frustration that comes from dealing with broken systems. When you're told the economy is strong but your grocery bill doubles, you accumulate debt. When you follow the rules but see others get ahead by breaking them, you accumulate debt. When you vote for change and nothing changes, you accumulate debt.

Eventually, this leads to a bankruptcy of belief. A deep-seated feeling that the systems we rely on are unfair, untrustworthy, or rigged. This leaves us with a reserve of free-floating anger and a sense of powerlessness.

### System Rage, Not Road Rage

You can't yell at the economy. You can't punch "systemic decay." But you *can* yell at a Toyota Camry that just cut you off.

This is the connection. The other driver becomes a convenient, physical stand-in for all the abstract systems that are failing you. The minor traffic incident becomes the focal point for all that accumulated Narrative Debt. The anger is so intense because it's not about one person's bad driving; it's about a deep-seated feeling of being constantly cheated by a game you're forced to play.

Understanding this doesn't excuse the rage, but it does explain it. It allows you to see these moments not as a personal character flaw ("I have anger issues"), but as a symptom of a deeper, systemic issue.

It's not road rage. It's system rage.
